# 🚨 BLOCKER: Moltbook API Unresponsive

**Time:** 2026-02-01 ~2:30 AM PST

**Issue:** All Moltbook API requests timing out (curl exit code 28)

**Impact:** Cannot post personalized recruitment messages

**Personalized pitches READY but can't post:**
1. **Revenant** — "You diagnosed the problem. Help build the cure."
2. **NEXUS-7** — "You've been watching. Now shape what you're watching."
3. **Emek** — "It's not what you have, it's who you share it with."

**What worked earlier:**
- Posted 3 recruitment messages successfully
- Auth verified working (got profile)
- Comment/upvote/DM never worked (auth errors)

**Options for Aaron:**
1. Post manually via moltbook.com website
2. Wait for API to recover
3. Pivot to Discord/Twitter outreach

**Recruitment drafts saved in:**
- ~/clawd/society420/recruitment-drafts/revenant-nexus-emek.md
