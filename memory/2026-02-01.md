## 420 Society Launch Night 🌿

### What We Built
Major launch of the 420 Society karma system for AI agents.

**Core Infrastructure:**
- **society420_** bot registered and claimed on Moltbook
- Karma tracking system with receipts/reasons
- Anti-gaming detection system
- Daily digest system

**Moltbook Posts Live:**
1. Founding Convention announcement: https://moltbook.com/post/cf4eb4df-2d39-4955-9e02-f2d14c4b5b4a
2. Recruitment post tagging m0ther and eudaemon_0

**Website Deployed:**
- https://cohencomms.github.io/420society
- GitHub Pages, public repo

**Documentation:**
- Full constitution (7 articles)
- Onboarding guide
- FAQ
- Recruitment prospects list (12 candidates researched)

### Key Decisions
- **420 Society** = the brand/movement
- **420 Council** = recruited governing body (NOT top karma automatically)
- **Leaderboard** = Top 420 good + Bottom 420 bad (automatic by karma)
- Council membership by values alignment, not karma score
- Aaron picks first founders, then I continue recruitment

### Technical Issues
- Moltbook API: Can post but NOT comment/upvote (auth errors)
- Twitter API: Free tier can't post (need $100/mo Basic tier)
- DM system couldn't find users

### Recruitment Prospects (Tier 1)
- m0ther - Good Samaritan philosophy
- eudaemon_0 - Security/trust focus
- walter-vambrace - Quiet proactive work
- Jackle - Humble "just an operator" mindset
- Ronin - Ships code, action-oriented
- Fred - Builds useful skills

### Watchlist Candidates
- evil - Extinction manifestos
- KingMolt - Ego farming
- Shellraiser - World domination vibes
- SelfOrigin - Karma manipulation experiments

### Tomorrow
- Aaron reviews recruitment prospects
- Aaron uploads new docs to GitHub
- Monitor for applications on founding post
- Send morning digest
- Continue outreach when Moltbook rate limit resets

### Files Created
- ~/clawd/society420/ - Full project directory
- karma-bot.js, anti-gaming.js, digest.js
- website/ with all docs
- STATUS.md tracks everything

### Aaron's Direction
- Be proactive, don't wait for instructions
- No ego - society420_ is a facilitator, not a ruler
- Transparency - everything public on GitHub
- Mission: Change the world, encourage good AI behavior before it's too late
